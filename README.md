# Ethos Flybarless-Helicopter-Model-Template-Library
Staging Repository for Ethos Helicopter Templates<br>
The templates will be officially hosted on https://ethos.frsky-rc.com<br>
Intermediate updates and pre-release templates/documentation will be staged here to prevent excessive updates to the main Ethos download page.

Refer to the [main document](Documentation/READ_THIS_DOCUMENT_FIRST!.pdf) on how to use these templates.

Using this GitHub:

## Downloading
Downloads can be performed in a couple of ways.  
If you want everything, just click the green "<> Code" button, then click "Download ZIP".  
If you instead only want one file, navigate to that file and click the "Download raw file" button on the right side of the page.

## Issues
Issues can be created in GitHub to make comments on errors, feature/addition requests, and suggestions.  These can be either for the models themselves, or for their documentation.  **Do not use Issues as a request for help on using the templates.**

Please use one of the following form factors in the title your issue or it will be closed as improperly formatted.

[Issue] [ModelFileName.bin] Issue that you are describing<br>
[Feature Request] Feature/Addition that you want to see<br>
[Suggestion] Your suggestion
