# FrSky-Ethos-Helicopter-Templates
Staging Repository for Ethos Helicopter Templates
The templates will be officially hosted on https://ethos.frsky-rc.com, but intermediate updates and pre-release templates/documentation will be staged here to prevent excessive updates to the main Ethos download page.

How to use this repository:
1. Navigate to the [main introduction document](Documentation/READ_THIS_DOCUMENT_FIRST!.pdf) and read it.
2. Read it.
3. Navigate to the Model Files folder and download whichever model you want to use.
4. Find the corresponding .pdf documentation for that model in the Documentation/Models folder.
